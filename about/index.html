<div class="elegant-text">
  <p>Hi! I'm Enol, a computer engineer living in Gij√≥n (north of Spain).</p>
  <p>I love music, arcade video games, films and series. And I also enjoy reading books (specially Game of Thrones). In my free time I try to learn play guitar. I'd like to write about coding, ruby, RoR, techs, thoughts, dreams, green goblins...</p>
  <p>Be more than welcome! <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i></p>
