Hi there! the past 19th April, and coinciding with my incorporation in [Bizneo](https://www.bizneo.com/){:target="_blank"}, I had the oportunity to give a talk in the [CiudadReal.rb](http://ciudadrealrb.org/){:target="_blank"} community. The topic was "Rack basics". A, so simple, talk about Rack.

## What's Rack:

> Rack provides a minimal, modular, and adaptable interface for developing web applications in Ruby. By wrapping HTTP requests and responses in the simplest way possible, it unifies and distills the API for web servers, web frameworks, and software in between (the so-called middleware) into a single method call.

## The slides:

## The talk
Is in Spanish :P
