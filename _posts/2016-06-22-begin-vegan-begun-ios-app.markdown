Today, I would like to announce my first iOS mobile application.

[Begin Vegan Begun vegan recipes](https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/begin-vegan-begun-recetas/id1090760348){:target="_blank"}

This is the app for the vegan recipes blog [Begin Vegan Begun](http://beginveganbegun.es/){:target="_blank"}. And it's developed with [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/){:target="_blank"}.

If you're reding this. Maybe you want to read the [previous post](/blog/begin-vegan-begun-android-app/) where I'm talking about the Android one. And about the process of development. Because this post it's a little spam :P

As always, all comments are more than welcome. And feel free to tell me whatever you want. You can find me on twitter [@enoliglesias](https://twitter.com/enoliglesias){:target="_blank"} :)
