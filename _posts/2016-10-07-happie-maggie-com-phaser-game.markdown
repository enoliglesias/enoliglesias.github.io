Today, I'm going to talk about our first complete and "profesional" videogame.

This videogame was developed with [Phaser](http://phaser.io/){:target="_blank"}. A JS framework wich helps and allows you to develop html5 videogames easily.

You need two basic skills to develop a phaser game:

* Javascript
* Pixelart

I made this videogame with a couple of coworkers: [claralisse](https://twitter.com/Claraliss3){:target="_blank"} and [@fixr](https://twitter.com/fixr){:target="_blank"}. And we win the tech contest of our company. [http://concursotech.the-cocktail.com/](http://concursotech.the-cocktail.com/){:target="_blank"}

We made it in order to raise awareness in our office, so people don't feed our little pet dog :) (she gets sick)

You can also take a look to my very first try with Phaser: [Escape from the pinkies](/escape-from-the-pinkies) where you can play with a pixelated version of me, shooting some rare cute pinky dogs.

And that's all! You can find me on twitter [@enoliglesias](https://twitter.com/enoliglesias){:target="_blank"} for whatever you want to ask.
